# Help Assets

Canonical help/control visuals are sourced from:

- `assets/help/icons/transform/svg` (external SVG icon pack used by menus and helper panels)
- `assets/help/manifest.json` (asset contract for help surfaces)

Legacy GIF guides were removed from repository history and runtime contracts.
