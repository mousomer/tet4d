# Assets and Media Licensing

Unless a file or directory contains an explicit separate license/attribution notice:

- All images, screenshots, icons, and other media under:
  - assets/
  - docs/assets/
  are licensed under the same terms as the codebase: PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0.

If third-party assets are added later, they must include explicit attribution and license terms in this file (or in a nearby LICENSE/NOTICE file in the same directory).
