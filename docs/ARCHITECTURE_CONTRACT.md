# Architecture Contract (Incremental Refactor)

This document defines the target dependency boundaries for `tet4d` and the
incremental enforcement strategy used while refactoring.

## Goals

- Preserve gameplay behavior while improving maintainability.
- Establish stable module boundaries and dependency direction.
- Keep CI green during incremental refactors.

## Target Boundaries

### Engine (`tet4d.engine`)

- Pure game logic and deterministic state transitions.
- No `pygame` imports.
- No file I/O or runtime persistence side effects in core update paths.
- No imports from UI adapters or tooling.

### Engine Core (`tet4d.engine.core`)

- Strict-purity subtree for extracted deterministic logic slices.
- No `pygame`, `tet4d.ui`, tooling imports, file I/O, `time`, `logging`, or `print`.
- `random` usage is isolated to `tet4d.engine.core.rng` for injected RNG support.

### UI Adapter (`tet4d.ui.pygame` planned)

- Owns `pygame` event loop, rendering, audio playback, and input mapping.
- Depends on `tet4d.engine.api` only (target state).

### Replay (`tet4d.replay` planned)

- Replay schema and serialization/deserialization live outside engine core.
- Engine consumes replay data, not replay files.
- Stage 8 enforces `tet4d.replay` -> `tet4d.engine.api` only (no deep engine imports).

### AI / Playbot (`tet4d.ai`)

- Depends on `tet4d.engine.api` (and replay schema if needed).
- Must not depend on deep engine internals long-term.
- Stage 6 introduces `tet4d.ai.playbot` as the stable AI seam while playbot internals
  are still physically hosted under `tet4d.engine.playbot` during migration.

### Tools (`tools/*`)

- Governance, benchmarks, and stability tools should use stable public engine APIs.
- Stage 7 enforces `tet4d.engine.api`-only imports for stability/playbot benchmark tools.
- Renderer profiling tools may use `tet4d.ui.pygame` adapter seams while UI extraction remains in progress.

## Dependency Direction (Target)

- `ui` -> `engine.api`
- `ai` -> `engine.api`
- `tools` -> `engine.api`
- `replay` -> `engine.api`
- `engine` -> (no `ui`, no `tools`, no `pygame`)

## 2D / 3D / 4D Principle

- 2D/3D/4D modes are configuration and adapter concerns over shared engine logic.
- Mode-specific rendering and input handling belong in UI adapters.
- Shared rules (collision, scoring, topology, rotations) belong in engine core.

## Enforcement Strategy (Incremental)

- Stage 1 introduces a boundary check script and wires it into policy checks.
- Because `src/tet4d/engine/` is currently mixed (logic + `pygame` adapters),
  the initial checker uses a locked baseline for existing `pygame` imports and
  fails on new violations.
- Stage 8 also locks the current `src/tet4d/ui/` deep-engine import baseline while
  enforcing strict `engine -> replay` and `replay/ai/tools -> engine.api` rules.
- Stage 9 adds a strict `engine/core` purity gate and architecture metrics (`scripts/arch_metrics.py`)
  to track remaining deep imports and side-effect migration debt.
- Future stages tighten this until `pygame` imports are fully removed from engine.
