## 2. Core rules derived from those sources

1. Keep keyboard behavior predictable and consistent across menu contexts.
2. Preserve visible focus and contrast in all menu states and window sizes.
3. Keep help in predictable locations and retain direct in-game access.
4. Prefer short, scannable labels and shallow menu depth.
5. Show immediate status feedback after user actions (save/load/reset/apply).
6. Keep context menus context-specific and avoid overloading them as global navigation.
7. Prefer recognition over recall: place key/action hints near controls.

## 3. Current issues (open backlog)

1. `BKL-P1-005` is closed: default macbook 4D camera bindings now have no keypad dependency.
2. `BKL-P1-006` is closed for core IA pass: launcher/pause menu flows were simplified and relabeled for user-friendly navigation.
3. Continuous watch items remain in `P3` (`BKL-P3-001`..`BKL-P3-005`).
4. Canonical source of active status is `docs/BACKLOG.md`.
